# checkAndDo-PatternDemo

### Why another design pattern?
- It is a widely common task in Software to perform tests on an object and obtain the result of this process. Letâ€™s imagine a pipeline of checks that an entity has to pass before being persisted to a database. On every step, we want to return the reason for the check failure, if it does. Otherwise, we want to proceed to the next check.
